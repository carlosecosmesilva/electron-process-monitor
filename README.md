## **✨ Features**

-   📌 **Process Listing:** Displays all active processes in the system.
-   📊 **Resource Monitoring:** Shows CPU and memory usage per process.
-   ❌ **Process Termination:** Allows users to terminate processes directly from the interface.
-   🔌 **Inter-Process Communication:** Utilizes **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** for data exchange between the **Main Process** and the **Renderer Process**.

## **🛠 Technologies Used**

-   **Electron** (for building the desktop app)
-   **TypeScript** (for type safety and code structure)
-   **Node.js** (using native modules like `child_process` and `os`)
